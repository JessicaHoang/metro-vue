# metro-vue
Metro-vue is an application that allows users to vue the arrival times of their preferred station and lines. The users will be able to select a station and line to view the arrival times and information about that station. In this application, I was unable to get the backend to work at this time due to limited time, but I will be able to do so in the future. This application so far will show case Metro-vue's front end design and usage of the components.
